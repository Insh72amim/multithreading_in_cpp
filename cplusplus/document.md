# Threads in C++

## Class `thread`

Class to represent individual threads of execution.

A thread of execution is a sequence of instructions that can be executed concurrently with other such sequences in multithreading environments, while sharing a same address space.

An initialized thread object represents an active thread of execution; Such a thread object is joinable, and has a unique thread id.

A default-constructed (non-initialized) thread object is not joinable, and its thread id is common for all non-joinable threads.

A joinable thread becomes not joinable if moved from, or if either join or detach are called on them.
